## Our Pledge

As members of this project team, we pledge to work collaboratively, communicate openly, and uphold integrity in our contributions. We commit to treating each other with respect, valuing diverse perspectives, and ensuring that our app is developed ethically and inclusively. We will hold ourselves accountable for maintaining a positive and professional environment where every team member feels heard and supported."

## Decisions

We will make team decisions based on a majority vote, ensuring that every member has an opportunity to voice their opinions before a final decision is made. We commit to engaging in respectful discussions, considering all perspectives, and supporting the outcome of the vote to maintain unity and progress in our project. While majority rules, we will strive for consensus whenever possible and handle disagreements professionally."

## Attendance 

We pledge to be present and engaged in all scheduled meetings and work sessions. Each team member is responsible for attending on time, actively participating, and notifying the group in advance if they are unable to attend. We recognize that consistent attendance is essential to the success of our project, and we will hold ourselves accountable for staying informed and contributing, even when absent."
