## Metrics Collection Guide

- **Signup Rate - Amount of people who signed up/ Total amount of people who downloaded the app**
  - We are tracking the sign-up rate to understand how many users are taking the extra step beyond just visiting the platform. This data is especially important if we introduce a guest feature in the future, as it will help measure the conversion of guests into registered, active users.

- **User Engagement - Daily active users/Game sign up rate/Messages sent**
  - We are tracking the daily active users to see how many people consistently use the app. We are also tracking how often users sign up for games as well as how often they send meesages, to see if users are interacting with the community.
