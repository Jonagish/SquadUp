# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct


## Our Pledge

As members of this project team, we pledge to work collaboratively, communicate openly, and uphold integrity in our contributions. We commit to treating each other with respect, valuing diverse perspectives, and ensuring that our app is developed ethically and inclusively. We will hold ourselves accountable for maintaining a positive and professional environment where every team member feels heard and supported."

## Decisions

We will make team decisions based on a majority vote, ensuring that every member has an opportunity to voice their opinions before a final decision is made. We commit to engaging in respectful discussions, considering all perspectives, and supporting the outcome of the vote to maintain unity and progress in our project. While majority rules, we will strive for consensus whenever possible and handle disagreements professionally."

## Attendance 

We pledge to be present and engaged in all scheduled meetings and work sessions. Each team member is responsible for attending on time, actively participating, and notifying the group in advance if they are unable to attend. We recognize that consistent attendance is essential to the success of our project, and we will hold ourselves accountable for staying informed and contributing, even when absent."

## Assignments 

We will distribute assignments fairly based on individual strengths, interests, and workload balance. Tasks will be assigned through group discussions, and each member is expected to complete their work on time and at a high standard.

**If a member fails to complete or poorly completes an assignment**, the team will first address the issue through direct communication, offering support if needed. If the problem persists, the team will escalate the matter by discussing reassignment, redistribution of tasks, or involving the instructor if necessary. Our goal is to maintain accountability while fostering a supportive and productive environment.

## Participation 

We pledge to actively contribute to the success of our project by participating in discussions, meetings, and group work. Every member is expected to share ideas, give constructive feedback, and assist teammates when needed. We value equal participation and will encourage quieter members to share their thoughts while ensuring no one dominates the conversation.

If a member is consistently disengaged or not contributing, the team will address the concern privately and collaboratively find solutions to re-engage them. Our goal is to create an environment where everyone's participation is meaningful and valued

## Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums

We pledge to meet as a team three times a week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, unless otherwise agreed upon. Meetings will be held either in person or virtually through a platform agreed upon by the team (such as Zoom or Google Meet), depending on availability and convenience.

All members are expected to attend these meetings on time and come prepared to contribute. If a member is unable to attend, they must inform the team in advance and stay updated on what was discussed. We agree to remain flexible and communicate clearly if adjustments to our meeting schedule or format are needed.

## Agenda and Minutes /Notes

We pledge to have a clear agenda prepared before each meeting to ensure our time is used effectively and all important topics are covered. The agenda will be shared with the team in advance so members can review and suggest additional items.

## Promptness 

We pledge to respect each other's time by being prompt to all meetings, work sessions, and deadlines. Arriving on time and submitting work by the agreed-upon due dates helps keep our project on track and ensures fairness to all team members.

## Conversational Courtesies

We pledge to maintain respectful and professional communication at all times. During meetings and group discussions, we will listen actively, avoid interrupting others, and allow everyone a chance to speak. We agree to provide constructive feedback and handle disagreements calmly and respectfully.

## Enforcement/ Feedback

We pledge to hold each other accountable to the standards set in this Code of Conduct. If any concerns or violations arise, we will address them respectfully and directly as a team, seeking to resolve issues through open and honest communication.

Feedback will be welcomed throughout the project to ensure everyone feels heard and valued. We commit to giving and receiving feedback in a constructive and supportive manner, focusing on solutions rather than blame.

If problems persist after group discussion, we agree to involve the instructor or project supervisor to help mediate and find a resolution. Our goal is to maintain a positive, productive, and fair working environment for everyone.
