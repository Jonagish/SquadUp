## Observation 1: Team Member - Isaac Craft

**Observation Statement:**
Users primarily rely on informal methods such as word of mouth, group chats, visiting local courts, or asking friends to find and join sports pick-up games. A significant number of users do not currently participate in pick-up games, and some are unfamiliar with the concept.

**Supporting Data:**
Many users mention asking friends or using group chats to organize games.
Some users go directly to local parks, gyms, or courts and ask to join ongoing games.
A portion of users use online platforms such as Google, social media, or apps like IMLeagues.
A considerable number of users do not actively seek or participate in pick-up games.
Several users are unaware of what a pick-up game is or how to find one.

**Team Action (if any):**
Consider implementing a feature that connects users with local pick-up games based on location and interests.
Provide educational content on what pick-up games are and how to join them.
Integrate existing platforms like IMLeagues or social media for better event discovery.
Offer a way for users to create and share games within the app, facilitating easier organization.

**Team Action (if any):**
Implement a real-time court/facility availability tracker or a map feature for sports venues.

## Observation 3: Team Member - Jonas Genao

**Observation Statement:** Users regard communication as crucial when it comes to coordinating 

**Supporting Data:** 
"Very important because of how many people will be there and where everyone is meeting"

"I think it’s important because communication and teamwork is crucial for a team. Bonding outside of games is also super important to grow an improved connection with your team."

"Communicating with players before a game is extremely important for several reasons: Setting Expectations – Players need to understand game plans, strategies, and any specific roles they are expected to play. Clear communication helps align everyone with the team’s objectives. Motivation & Mindset – Pre-game talks can help boost confidence, build team spirit, and mentally prepare players for competition. A strong pep talk can set the tone for performance."

**Team Action (if any):**
Implement an in-app messaging option to allow for communication.

"Sometimes I just show up at the park and hope there’s a game."

"I don’t always plan ahead; I like to play whenever I have free time."

"It would be cool if there was a way to see last-minute games happening near me."

"I don’t want to commit too far in advance because my schedule changes a lot."

**Team Action (if any):**
Implement a "Drop-in" or "Last-Minute Games" feature that highlights games available soon.
