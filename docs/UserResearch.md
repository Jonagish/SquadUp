## Observation 1: Team Member - Isaac Craft

**Observation Statement:**
Users primarily rely on informal methods such as word of mouth, group chats, visiting local courts, or asking friends to find and join sports pick-up games. A significant number of users do not currently participate in pick-up games, and some are unfamiliar with the concept.

**Supporting Data:**
Many users mention asking friends or using group chats to organize games.
Some users go directly to local parks, gyms, or courts and ask to join ongoing games.
A portion of users use online platforms such as Google, social media, or apps like IMLeagues.
A considerable number of users do not actively seek or participate in pick-up games.
Several users are unaware of what a pick-up game is or how to find one.

**Team Action (if any):**
Consider implementing a feature that connects users with local pick-up games based on location and interests.
Provide educational content on what pick-up games are and how to join them.
Integrate existing platforms like IMLeagues or social media for better event discovery.
Offer a way for users to create and share games within the app, facilitating easier organization.

**Supporting Data:**
"Making sure the court is empty"
"Is there a facility near me for the sport I want to play?"
"The court can be packed and it ends up being hard to find a game."

**Team Action (if any):**
Implement a real-time court/facility availability tracker or a map feature for sports venues.
