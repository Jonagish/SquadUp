Supporting Data:
Many users mention asking friends or using group chats to organize games.
Some users go directly to local parks, gyms, or courts and ask to join ongoing games.
A portion of users use online platforms such as Google, social media, or apps like IMLeagues.
A considerable number of users do not actively seek or participate in pick-up games.
Several users are unaware of what a pick-up game is or how to find one.

Team Action (if any):
Consider implementing a feature that connects users with local pick-up games based on location and interests.
Provide educational content on what pick-up games are and how to join them.
Integrate existing platforms like IMLeagues or social media for better event discovery.
Offer a way for users to create and share games within the app, facilitating easier organization.
